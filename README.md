# WikiContext

Current release controls and platform coverage: [common CI and deployment contract](docs/ci-and-deployment.md).

An agent-maintained knowledge base on PocketContext. Sources, extracted passages, versioned pages, citations, links and publication history live in WikiContext. The browser reader renders published pages and updates when agents publish. Obsidian consumes a reproducible Markdown export. Ingestion and agent questions use the portable skill and authenticated APIs.

Existing knowledge lives in the Company space. Admitted Workspace users receive company editor membership when their account is created; operators manage subsequent membership changes, and login never restores a revoked membership. Personal spaces are optional and created explicitly. SQL, REST, realtime and protected files independently enforce active space membership. PocketBase's existing default `users` collection supplies identities, with verified Workspace Google JIT and public signup blocked. New accounts never receive account administration. Operators disable accounts to revoke application sessions; Google suspension alone does not revoke an existing session. Re-enabling requires fresh login. Seven-day tokens renew during active Google client use.

## Run locally

Build the commit in `POCKETCONTEXT_VERSION` with its specified Go version, CGO and a C compiler:

```sh
# From a PocketContext checkout at the pinned revision:
make build
# From this application directory:
/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext serve --dir ./pb_data --http 127.0.0.1:8090
```

The pinned build includes `sqlite_math_functions,sqlite_percentile,sqlite_fts5`.
Filtered SQL reuses bounded per-user snapshots until the database changes.
Authentication is checked on every request; committed writes invalidate cached
snapshots, including membership changes. The first read after a write rebuilds
the snapshot. Search and ingestion keep their existing APIs and conflict checks.
Authenticated SQL supports `json_each`/`json_tree` and median/percentile aggregates.
Published-page search uses authenticated private FTS5 indexes derived from a
requester-visible publication, with generation-checked pagination. See the
[search contract and maintenance guide](docs/fts-adoption.md).

Keep data outside Git. Provision users through operator maintenance, or configure a separate Google Web client with `WIKICONTEXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `WIKICONTEXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `WIKICONTEXT_GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN`. Register `http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback` and the approved origin's `/api/oauth2-redirect`. Use ordinary user credentials for knowledge operations. Production runs at https://wiki.pocketcontext.com. See [release verification](DEPLOYMENT.md) and [deployment procedures](docs/deployment.md).

## Browser reader

Open the application origin and sign in with your Workspace Google identity.
Existing password accounts can use the secondary password form. The reader is
read-only; agents continue to ingest, synthesize and publish through the skill.
Search opens ranked published-page results with plain excerpts and Load more.
The sidebar collection selector browses Pages, Sources and Passages. Source/passage text filtering searches evidence in the selected space, including evidence not yet cited in a publication, with paginated URL state. Permanent `/#/sources/<id>` and `/#/passages/<id>` links support authenticated evidence navigation and protected original downloads; source pages link to their passages. Copy record/search links exclude temporary file tokens. Page controls copy live or publication-pinned historical links. The sidebar remains available for browsing. `/` or Ctrl/Cmd+K focuses search; query
and publication are preserved in navigation. Wiki links, backlinks, an outline and
source citations support navigation. A citation opens its original passage and
offers an authenticated original-file download.

The live view adopts complete publications and rechecks after reconnect or tab
focus. Selecting a historical publication pins the view until you return to live.
Same-space published-page navigation and publication refreshes retain the complete
displayed view until its replacement is ready; temporary network failures leave it readable.
Immutable publication validation, directories and page details share bounded
in-memory session caches. Directory and evidence counts must match their selected
publication before retention; incomplete reads can be retried. Private content is
never persisted by these caches.
Membership checks run on focus, reconnect, publication events and every minute,
including during slow content reads. Confirmed access loss discards cached data,
clears affected views and rejects pending responses. Logout or an identity change
also discards all reader caches. Unchanged publications reuse cached content.
See [performance behavior and server adoption](docs/reader-performance.md)
for cache bounds, isolated measurements and release prerequisites.
Each publication can select a home page. `/#/` opens that page and the sidebar marks it Home; unset or cleared choices open the built-in welcome index. Historical views retain their home choice, and explicit page links stay stable. The Welcome link (`/#/welcome`) always opens a searchable, topic-grouped index of every unarchived page in the selected publication, with an A–Z view and onboarding links drawn only from available pages. New or uncategorized pages remain visible under Other knowledge. Welcome and sidebar search use the same full-text search across published titles, summaries and contents. The sidebar starts with topic navigation; expand All pages for the complete catalog. The welcome directory supports topic browsing and an A–Z view, while additional onboarding guides remain under All onboarding guides. No company page catalog is bundled into the reader.
Unpublished revisions are never selected. Markdown supports tables, code, wiki
links with aliases/heading anchors, citation markers and callouts. Raw HTML and
embedded images are disabled. Obsidian plugins, block embeds, editing and two-way
vault synchronization are outside this reader's scope.

Published revision properties appear below the page summary, with additional fields
under All properties. Field evidence opens the existing citation dialog; values
without citations are labelled accordingly. Relationship links resolve within the
selected publication. Resources, Credentials, Deployments, People and Groups in the sidebar open
catalog views with property search, provider/deployment/lifecycle filters, missing
ownership, sorting and 50-record pagination. Filters and publication selection are
shareable URL state. Catalog search covers recorded properties and relationship
names; full-text search continues to cover titles, summaries and page bodies.
Catalogs use the complete selected publication, update atomically in live mode and
show cards on mobile. People and Groups expose membership and group ownership
within the selected publication. Person pages can record role, organization and a
reviewed CRM link; group pages record purpose and members. Membership represents
accountability, grants no permissions and sends no notifications. Nested groups
and automatic CRM synchronization are outside scope. Agents maintain these
relationships through cited revisions; properties are read-only in the browser.

The Audio catalog groups recordings by published `audio_recording` entities. Each entry pins its selected Gemini bundle and links reviewed transcript/summary pages. Protected audio, transcript, generated analysis, translation and provenance remain evidence previews; timestamps are approximate. New imports do not silently change published selections. See [audio catalog workflow](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md#audio-recording-catalog).

The reader defaults to Company. Choose **Create personal space** to opt in, then
use the Space selector to switch. New personal spaces are empty until an agent
publishes there. Existing unscoped page links keep opening company knowledge;
new personal-space links retain their space. Publication and evidence IDs resolve
within their own authorized space. See [spaces and migration](docs/spaces.md).

Frontend source is in `ui/`: React, TypeScript and Vite, with bundled Markdown
rendering and the PocketBase SDK. Content reads use authenticated SQL; the SDK
handles ordinary user authentication, protected file tokens and SSE notifications.
The official PocketBase SDK LocalAuthStore keeps the application token in local
storage under `wikicontext.reader.auth`, shared across tabs and browser restarts.
If browser storage is blocked, login uses memory only and reloading requires
sign-in again. Clearing site storage in another tab also clears the active session.
Logout synchronizes across tabs and clears reader state and subscriptions; account
changes discard pending responses and private views. Tokens remain accessible to
same-origin JavaScript. Active sessions renew at most every five minutes. Legacy
per-tab credentials are discarded, so the first visit after upgrading requires login. No provider secret is shipped to the browser.

Google login opens a popup directly from the sign-in button, preserves the SDK's
state and PKCE checks, and expires after three minutes. Blocked popups show retry
guidance; users can cancel a pending attempt. Cancelled or expired attempts cannot
save a late session. The browser callback remains `/api/oauth2-redirect`; CLI
login uses the separately registered loopback callback.

With Node.js 24 and pnpm 10.33.2:

```sh
cd ui
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Run the pinned server from the application directory, then open its root URL.
The application hooks serve `ui/dist` with a restrictive Content Security Policy.
For frontend development, `pnpm dev` proxies `/api` to `127.0.0.1:8090`.
The production container builds and serves static assets without a Node runtime.
Do not commit `ui/dist` or browser test output.

## Portable skill

The standalone launcher `skills/wikicontext/wikicontext` requires Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Add its directory to `PATH` to use the commands below. Its first run installs the client from a pinned Git revision. For development and validation, install the current package in a virtual environment with `python3 -m pip install .`. Release the tested package commit first, then update the launcher to that full commit and verify the copied launcher through uv. The package pins its ObserveContext instrumentation dependency separately.


Install with `npx skills add pocketcontext/wikicontext --skill wikicontext`, or copy `skills/wikicontext/` to your agent's skill directory. It works outside this repository. Set `WIKICONTEXT_URL` and `WIKICONTEXT_USER_EMAIL`; use Google login or the optional `WIKICONTEXT_USER_PASSWORD` for an existing account.

```sh
wikicontext login --google
wikicontext check
wikicontext spaces
wikicontext create-personal-space
wikicontext --space SPACE_ID ingest /path/to/private-source.md
wikicontext ingest /path/to/source.md
wikicontext search 'launch date'
wikicontext lint
wikicontext export-obsidian /path/to/vault
```

Over SSH, forward the CLI loopback port from your browser computer with `ssh -L 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 user@host`. The authentication cache contains only the application token with private permissions. `logout` removes that token cache; it does not revoke copies elsewhere or remove the separate private audio and extraction caches.

Commands default to Company unless `--space ID` or `WIKICONTEXT_SPACE` explicitly
selects another readable space. Creating a personal space does not change that
default. Use separate Obsidian destinations for different spaces. Legacy exports
without space metadata can be adopted only by Company after ordinary ownership
checks. SQL returns all spaces you can read; add a `space` filter for one space.
Older installed clients must be upgraded before using personal spaces; the new
package must be published and its portable launcher pinned before release.

The `ingest` command uploads an immutable source and extracts passages; audio is normalized before upload by default. The agent then follows the skill to synthesize summaries/concepts, create citations/links, and publish a staging run. Uploading/extracting alone is not a completed knowledge-ingestion workflow. The server validates publication and rejects stale synthesis with 409. Use `wikicontext stage-home RUN_ID --home SLUG --expected-revision N` (or `--clear-home`) to stage the home choice and capture its expected base. Publish using the returned run revision without home flags. Home-only runs are supported; concurrent home changes return 409 and require reassessment. Direct `publish --home`/`--clear-home` requires an explicit `--home-base` page ID or empty string. No LLM runs inside the server or Markdown exporter.

Supported extraction: reviewed PNG/JPEG/WebP images; UTF-8 text/Markdown and related text formats; text PDFs using local `pdftotext`; and audio through the pinned Gemini Transcribe client. Audio ingestion authorizes sending the recording to Gemini. The default stores mono Ogg Opus encoded from 24 kHz input at 32 kbps, verifies duration and the 100 MiB source limit, and processes those exact bytes. Original input files remain unchanged. Input hashes, conversion settings and converter versions are retained in private cache metadata and stored Ogg provenance. `--audio-storage original` preserves input bytes instead. Require uv, Python 3.12+, FFmpeg/ffprobe and `GEMINI_API_KEY` for generation. The WikiContext client itself still supports Python 3.11; uv runs Gemini in its separate compatible environment.

```sh
wikicontext ingest recording.m4a --language Italian --version gemini-standard-1
# Resume explicitly with the saved workflow receipt and the same source/options:
wikicontext ingest recording.m4a --language Italian --version gemini-standard-1 --resume /private/workflow/receipt.json
```

The default Gemini `standard` pipeline produces a v2 transcript/analysis/translation bundle. Translation defaults to English; `--translation-language` changes it independently of the original transcript. The experimental `--pipeline long-decode` remains explicit. Safe validation diagnostics identify failed stages/reasons without exposing transcript text or provider responses. Backward segment starts and reversed intervals preserve the candidate evidence with timing warnings; invalid numeric values and out-of-duration timestamps remain fatal. Native passages omit impossible playback ranges. Warning-bearing evidence requires a bundle-specific review note before publication; pass `--timing-review-note` to `stage-audio` after reviewing affected audio. Completed stages are reused and incomplete enrichment is resumable. An authorized agent workflow includes up to three paid retry invocations without renewed approval, following the [retry policy](skills/wikicontext/references/retries.md). CLI/SDK automatic generation retries remain disabled and no provider fallback occurs. Gemini is the only transcription provider; the former Groq route has been removed, and existing Groq evidence remains immutable.

After extraction, the agent reviews evidence and stages cited transcript/summary pages. `wikicontext stage-audio RUN_ID --receipt /private/ingest.json --transcript-page ID --summary-page ID` stages the matching Audio catalog entry and bundle selection. It validates existing evidence and preserves published identities; it does not generate prose or publish. The skill continues through atomic publication and verifies the catalog, selected extraction, protected playback/artifacts and page links before reporting ingestion complete. See the [audio workflow](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md#audio).

Precomputed Gemini Transcribe bundles can be imported without retranscribing:

```sh
wikicontext --space companyspace001 ingest recording.m4a \
  --transcript-bundle /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --audio-storage original --version gemini-v1
```

This requires a complete v2 bundle and the exact original audio (up to 100 MiB).
It validates all source/artifact hashes, paths, references and timestamps before
uploads, preserves every declared artifact and manifest, and creates timestamped
native passages with segment-to-passage mappings. Tone and uncertainty receive
separate, explicitly labelled model-observation passages and receipt mappings. No provider call, conversion or provider key is needed. Local `ffprobe`
(from FFmpeg) independently verifies the preserved audio duration before uploads. Identical retries resume; changed
content under the same version conflicts. Analysis, translation and format variants
are derived artifacts, not independent corroboration. The receipt means extracted,
not published: follow the [external bundle workflow](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md#external-transcript-bundles)
for review, citations and publication. No backend migration is required.


Both `standard` (Interactions) and opt-in `long-decode` (GenerateContent) use the
same v2 bundle import command. Choose the pipeline in Gemini Transcribe, then
import with distinct `--version` labels (for example `gemini-standard-1` and
`gemini-long-decode-1`). Importing either version does not replace published
selections or citations. Review and explicitly publish a selected extraction.

Optional `configuration.generation` uses `gemini-transcribe.generation/v1` to
record pipeline/API, SDK, configured limits and per-stage attempt/hop receipts.
The importer validates this metadata before writes; the five-field `extraction`
object remains unchanged. Historical bundles without versioned generation
metadata remain importable. In Audio → Files and provenance, the hash-verified
selected manifest supplies pipeline/model, actual continuation responses and
reported token totals across recorded attempts. Continuation being enabled does
not mean it occurred. Missing counts are unavailable, not zero; counts are not a
billing invoice. Opaque continuation tokens, prompts and raw provider responses
are never generation metadata. JSON artifacts remain limited to 8 MiB.

V2 bundles require `gemini-transcribe.speaker-names/v1` and display supported names
as `Alice (SPEAKER_01)` in native transcript passages. A single consistent name
with at least one explicit model mapping is eligible; tentative, conflicting,
unsafe or duplicate names retain speaker IDs. Reviewed overrides in manifest
`speaker_names` take precedence and retain their reasons separately from model
analysis. Canonical speaker IDs, segment IDs and timestamps remain unchanged.
The protected manifest and analysis preserve naming evidence and origin, linked
by the transcript-bundle rendition. Names are extraction claims, not verified
account identities. Older bundles and missing naming metadata are rejected.
Regenerate presentations from a v2 bundle locally with Gemini Transcribe's offline
export command, then import corrections with a new `--version`; existing passages,
citations and publications remain immutable. Publishing revised pages is explicit.

Pillow is installed automatically with the client package for reviewed image ingestion. Run `wikicontext ingest IMAGE --image-review REVIEW.json` after viewing the original and preparing reviewed evidence. The client verifies and decodes static PNG/JPEG/WebP images, requires matching extensions, limits dimensions to 16,384 pixels per axis and 50 million total pixels, and preserves the exact original bytes. Review JSON must match the original SHA-256 and encoded dimensions before upload. It separates transcription, visual description and captions into region-addressable passages. A changed review requires a new `--version`; identical reviewed input resumes interrupted writes. Related audio source IDs and screenshot sequence are recorded in rendition notes, without replacing the audio. Image ingestion makes no external OCR or vision-service request. See the [review format](skills/wikicontext/references/examples.md#reviewed-image-evidence) and [image workflow](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md#images). The reader previews PNG/JPEG/WebP originals on source and passage pages and in citation dialogs, with an enlarged view, actual-size scrolling, retry controls and protected original downloads. Previews clear when the source or signed-in identity changes. Other image formats remain download-only; previews do not add extraction or OCR.

Resource, credential, deployment, person and group pages can carry flat typed revision properties, property-specific citation evidence and stable page relationships. Properties share publication history and conflict checks with prose; existing pages remain unclassified until an agent publishes a reviewed revision. See the [property contract](docs/data-model.md#revision-properties-and-catalogs) and [catalog workflow](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md#catalog-properties). Store credential metadata and protected-storage references only, never secret values. Obsidian export includes these properties in its single YAML frontmatter block and resolves relationship IDs to wiki links.

For People/Groups adoption, first check published history for existing `members`,
`accountable_owners` and `backup_owners` properties that conflict with their new
relationship contracts. Do not assume these keys are unused or rewrite immutable
history. Publish the tested client package, update the portable launcher's pinned
commit and deploy the backend/UI before publishing person/group metadata. Use the
updated client for lint and export: older client validators reject the new catalog
types. Existing pages require no automatic classification or data migration when
the preflight finds no conflicting properties; adopt them through reviewed revisions.

### Prompts

The Prompts catalog lists reusable task prompts with search and recorded metadata
for purpose, target agents, required skills, inputs, approval boundaries and last
validation. Prompts use `repository_document` with `document_type: prompt`; GitHub
destinations are optional. The selected publication determines both metadata and
content. Preview, copy and download retain the prompt text, without adding wiki
commentary or executing it. Exact-copy originals require ordinary protected-file
access and hash/UTF-8 verification. Reader preview/copy/download is limited to
8 MiB of UTF-8 text. Markdown uses the repository export rules.

Existing documents become prompts only through a reviewed new revision. Publish
the updated client and deploy the backend/reader before classifying live content;
older validators do not accept `document_type: prompt`. Keep existing source,
identity, destinations and valid evidence when reclassifying. A metadata revision
requires a fresh sync observation even when the distributed bytes are unchanged.

### Repository files

The Repository files catalog keeps one authoritative document and separate GitHub
destinations for intentionally shared copies. READMEs, licenses, copyright files,
notices and contribution guides use the same publication and ownership model.
Matching bytes alone do not establish that two files should share one document.
Repository-specific variants remain separate documents. Archived applications are
excluded from routine adoption.

`repository_document` pages select plain Markdown or an immutable original for
exact copying. `repository_destination` pages identify a document, GitHub
repository, branch and relative file path. Separate `repository_sync` pages record
dated observations pinned to both document and destination revisions. Recording a
sync never changes the authoritative document. A recorded status is not a live
GitHub check; changed content or destination mappings require fresh comparison.

The portable client's `export-repository-file` command prepares one destination
from an explicitly selected publication in a new local output file. It does not
replace existing files, commit, push or publish a sync observation. Exact copies retain
original bytes and verify their source hash. Plain Markdown export fails closed
on unsupported wiki markup rather than silently changing its meaning. Metadata
and evidence stay outside exported license and copyright bytes.
Extensionless UTF-8 files such as `LICENSE`, `COPYRIGHT` and `NOTICE` can be ingested
directly; their original bytes are retained independently of extracted passages.

Follow the [repository files workflow](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md)
to adopt documents, compare independent GitHub edits, prepare reviewable diffs and
record completed or pending updates. Publishing a wiki revision never triggers a
GitHub rollout. Do not infer copyright holders or automatically advance years.
Existing content is not automatically classified or imported. Release the tested
package and backend/reader before publishing the new catalog types; older client
validators do not recognize them.

The exporter writes `wiki/` and `raw/` under the destination. Numbered source footnotes, wiki-links, page metadata, index and publication log are deterministic. Exports pin one immutable publication; `--sequence N` selects history. An ownership manifest detects local edits/deletions, prevents overwriting unrelated files, and supports interrupted-export recovery. `.obsidian/` remains untouched. Avoid concurrent local editing during export; the exporter lock coordinates exporters, not external editors. Use a fresh destination for initial migration: existing authored wiki files are not silently adopted. Downloaded files cannot be revoked remotely.

See [data model](docs/data-model.md) and [skill workflows](skills/wikicontext/references/workflows.md) for synthesis, idempotency, queries, corrections and publication. Structural lint does not establish semantic correctness. Full-text search indexes published revision title, summary and body; it uses token matching rather than the former arbitrary substring matching. It does not provide vector search or generated answers. Raw SQL queries must explicitly distinguish draft revisions from the published manifest.

## SQL diagnostics

For an optional Python CLI experiment that ranks a full published snapshot using
OpenAI's metered API, see [the semantic search proof of concept](tools/semantic_search_poc/README.md).
Preparation is read-only; model searches upload the selected corpus to OpenAI.
This experiment does not replace the application's FTS search or browser UI.

For published-page body sizes, pin a publication sequence and expand its manifest:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS pages,
       median(length(r.body)) AS median_body_characters,
       percentile_cont(length(r.body), 0.95) AS p95_body_characters
FROM publications AS pub
JOIN json_each(pub.manifest) AS selected
JOIN page_revisions AS r ON r.id = selected.value AND r.page = selected.key
WHERE pub.space = 'companyspace001' AND pub.sequence = 1 AND r.archived = false;
```

Replace `1` with the selected publication sequence. This excludes drafts and
archived pages and returns one aggregate row. The statistics describe character
counts, not query latency or memory use; an empty publication returns NULL sizes.
`percentile_cont` takes a fraction from 0 to 1; `percentile` takes 0 to 100.

## Validation

Use synthetic isolated databases only. From this repository, with the pinned server built and `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` available for audio tests and Pillow installed for image tests:

```sh
python3 tests/launcher.py
python3 tests/integration.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext

```

For the cross-package evidence contract, install Gemini Transcribe 0.3.0 or newer
(bundle v2) in a separate environment and run:

```sh
python3 tests/gemini_handoff.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext \
  --gemini-python /absolute/path/to/gemini-transcribe/.venv/bin/python
```

This uses mocked Gemini responses and synthetic audio, then verifies native
passages, cited publication, protected downloads and byte-exact artifact export
against an isolated WikiContext server. It makes no transcription-provider calls.
When validating changes to the timing-warning policy, repeat this command with
`--timing-warnings` and `--gemini-python` pointing to the changed Gemini source
environment. This adds reversed-interval and backward-start evidence, review
requirements and publication checks. The default fixture stays compatible with
older published Gemini packages. CI now runs `--timing-warnings` against the
verified warning-capable Gemini pin. Future adoption must publish and verify the
Gemini release before updating runtime or CI pins; never pin an unpublished commit.

After building the reader, install Chromium once and exercise the production
assets against a synthetic isolated database:

```sh
(cd ui && pnpm exec playwright install chromium)
python3 tests/ui_browser.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
```

The LocalAuthStore migration passed the backend validation commands above,
reader typecheck/build, 32 unit tests and four actual-server browser scenarios.
The added scenario covers independently opened tabs, reload, cross-tab account
changes/logout, restored deep links and rejection of legacy per-tab credentials.
Tests also cover realtime publications/reconnect, revocation, idle-token expiry
and late refresh.

The 30 September 2026 navigation change passed every validation command above
against the unchanged 91d7ef1 pin, reader typecheck, 32 unit tests, production
build and both actual-server browser scenarios (including evidence permalinks,
reload, collection search and keyboard navigation).

The Welcome and evidence layout update passed all 23 backend validation commands
against the unchanged 91d7ef1 pin, reader typecheck, 57 unit tests, production
build and all eight isolated browser scenarios. Browser checks include full-text
Welcome search, topic navigation, responsive evidence layout, protected image
enlargement, historical views and session isolation.

CI runs reader type checks, unit tests and the production browser suite before
image publication. Container smoke checks also verify the Python entrypoint and bundled assets.

Regenerate the SQL reference only after reviewing intentional changes: `tests/skill.py --binary ... --write-schema`. Container CI additionally runs configuration, persistence, crash restore and graceful shutdown checks. Main-branch image publication is gated on application tests and native container checks; deployment additionally requires the configured `COLORS_PROFILE` environment. Native AMD64/ARM64 container checks passed in release CI. A real Google browser login remains unverified; see the release record.

## Existing wiki migration

The runtime migration freeze and its server-pin release prerequisite are described
in [deployment procedures](docs/deployment.md#runtime-migration-freeze).

The existing `wiki/` checkout has not been modified or migrated. Import originals through ordinary API ingestion, retrieve actual Git LFS audio rather than its pointer, and import authored pages as explicitly labelled legacy revisions with mapped evidence. Preserve slugs, original citations and legacy log text; do not claim imported legacy logs are server audit events. Compare a fresh generated vault before switching Obsidian. Never use direct SQLite writes or production data for migration tests. A bulk legacy importer is not supplied in this version.

## Infrastructure provenance

Authentication and portable OAuth client adapted from RaiseContext `44f8f10537388f9a934a2bc1800d3df6a046c580`; revision/concurrency and realtime test patterns from TaskContext `5bb214ef32fcffa9a42bb1de2d13cfd4052dc80f`; protected originals, complete backups and container/deployment patterns from AccountContext `2b78c0f38680381376b0ce485312ff659037a13f`. WikiContext's domain schema and publication/export model are independent. The current server pin is recorded in `POCKETCONTEXT_VERSION`.

## Request observability

The pinned server enables an authenticated, bounded in-memory trace buffer for `wikicontext`. Collection is client opt-in; ordinary commands produce no traces. See [optional skill tracing](skills/wikicontext/references/tracing.md) for separate ObserveContext login, private upload, SQL-text consent, delivery retries and measurement limits. No ObserveContext credentials are installed on this server.

## Object storage deployment

The production container requires Litestream replication and private PocketBase S3 file storage.
The application can still run directly for isolated local development; the container
has no local-originals or replication-disabled mode.
Set all of `WIKICONTEXT_S3_BUCKET`, `WIKICONTEXT_S3_ENDPOINT`,
`WIKICONTEXT_S3_REGION`, `WIKICONTEXT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`WIKICONTEXT_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Optional `WIKICONTEXT_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`
is `true` by default. Partial settings stop startup without logging values.
Use a dedicated private bucket with no public downloads or lifecycle deletion.
Uploads and protected downloads still use PocketBase's ordinary authenticated API;
original checksums are streamed from its configured filesystem backend.
During a frozen restart, these values must match the stored backend and
credentials exactly; configuration changes are refused until an explicit thaw.

With this contract enabled, startup preserves a healthy local database or restores
an absent database from Litestream. Normal startup fails if the replica is absent;
first installation uses the explicit one-shot `init` command with an empty replica
target, followed by normal startup on the same volume. See the command examples
in [deployment procedures](docs/deployment.md). Before HTTP starts, the supervised child calls
Litestream's private mode-0600 IPC socket with `sync -wait`, forcing database
initialization and a completed initial remote sync. Startup intentionally requires
a reachable replica; missing IPC or failed synchronization refuses serving.
Explicit `init` deployments bootstrap the database with migrations before this
handshake. This closes Litestream 0.5.17's early-stop gap: before its first monitor
tick, an uninitialized database otherwise skips final replication on shutdown. It never restores the legacy complete archive,
and no archive scheduler runs. Before opening the server, it streams every original
referenced by SQLite from S3 and verifies its recorded SHA-256. Missing, corrupt or
inaccessible evidence refuses startup. This costs a full evidence read on restart;
measure duration and allow sufficient ONCE startup time. Other PocketBase file
fields use the same storage backend; the integrity gate specifically covers sources.

Setting S3 does not migrate existing local files. Use the verified file-copy
procedure in [the migration runbook](tools/MIGRATION.md) before enabling remote
storage on an existing dataset. The container no longer supports local originals,
complete archives, archive retention or backup scheduling. Historical archives
remain recoverable with the pinned older image described in the deployment guide. Do not
remove S3 configuration from a remote deployment or run legacy archive commands
against it. Litestream and file storage must use separate buckets and credentials.
Keep object retention at least as long as database recovery history. SQLite and S3
have no shared transaction: failed uploads can leave unreferenced objects, which
must not be automatically deleted based on a potentially stale restored database.

Exactly one application writer and replica publisher may operate per replica path.
For handover, stop the source cleanly, prevent its restart, restore into a separate
recovery location and compare the recovered committed database state with the
stopped source before starting the destination. Litestream 0.5.17 can exit zero
when its replica endpoint is unavailable; a clean process exit alone does not
prove final remote synchronization. Preserve the source volume until the recovered
state and all original-file hashes are verified. An unplanned host loss
can lose SQLite commits not yet replicated, even when uploaded objects survived.
No automatic cross-host fencing or zero-loss crash guarantee is provided.

For a disposable MinIO bucket only, install the package and `boto3`, set the S3
variables above, then run `python3 tests/object_storage_integration.py --binary
/absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext --synthetic-bucket EXACT_TEST_BUCKET` on
one line. The test uploads synthetic evidence, proves protected downloads and
remote hashing, restores a database with no local files, then deliberately corrupts
and deletes its own object to prove verification fails closed.

Before the spaces release, follow the [recovery checkpoint and disposable-clone
assessment](docs/predeployment-recovery.md). A production migration requires a
verified pre-migration checkpoint and an isolated restore rehearsal. No production
backup or migration is performed by the source changes.

The [production spaces cutover](docs/production-spaces-cutover.md) records the
authorized checkpoint destination, key recovery, delivery fences and migration
sequence. The [encrypted checkpoint helper](tools/CHECKPOINT.md) packages and
verifies complete off-host recovery independently of Litestream replication.

## Historical object-storage experiment

The separate experiment workflow has been removed. Production uses only the
main-only `once-v2` environment and common guarded release workflow. The retained
verification tools below are historical operator tools, not automatic deployment
paths or authorization to modify a live service. See the
[common CI and deployment contract](docs/ci-and-deployment.md).

For the standalone recovery test, set disposable MinIO S3 and Litestream settings
and run `python3 tests/object_storage_recovery.py --binary PINNED_SERVER
--litestream LITESTREAM_BINARY --synthetic-files-bucket TEST_FILES
--synthetic-replica-bucket TEST_REPLICA` on one line. For the actual image gate,
run `python3 docker/object_storage_smoke.py --image TEST_IMAGE --minio-image
LOCAL_MINIO_FIXTURE` on one line. Both use synthetic records and isolated replicas.

### Prepared live experiment verification

`tools/verify_experiment.py` is restricted to `https://wiki-v2.pocketcontext.com`
and the `wikicontext-v2-files` / `wikicontext-v2-replica` buckets. With experiment
credentials in the process environment and `boto3` installed, an explicitly
approved live check is:

```sh
python3 tools/verify_experiment.py --api-and-r2 --manifest /tmp/wiki-v2-synthetic-manifest.json
```

This creates a disposable default-users account with maintenance credentials,
then uploads one synthetic original as that ordinary user. It verifies the server
hash, protected download, anonymous denial and exact remote bytes. It disables the
disposable account in a finalizer. Immutable synthetic source evidence is retained.
Only check outcomes are printed; synthetic object metadata goes into a mode-0600
manifest, never credentials. Replica-object presence is checked separately and is
not proof that the latest write replicated.

To verify no local original remains, use the same script and synthetic manifest
inside the experimental container or against its mounted data directory:

```sh
python3 verify_experiment.py --check-local-storage /storage/pb_data --manifest /tmp/wiki-v2-synthetic-manifest.json
```

The script and manifest can be copied into the experimental container's `/tmp`
for this check and removed afterward. Do not print container environment or ONCE
labels when selecting the container. No live check is performed by preparing or
running `--help` on this script.

A migration gate must additionally stop the source and compare its database with
a fresh replica restore before destination activation:

```sh
python3 tests/object_storage_recovery.py --verify-source /stopped/data.db --verify-restored /restored/data.db
```

The comparator checks full integrity and logical schema/table/row contents without
printing source data. Keep the stopped source intact if comparison fails.

The actual-image S3 drill uses a one-hour remote sync interval and performs API
writes after the initial handshake. It strictly restores the replica into a
separate volume, compares every logical database record with the stopped source,
and only then destroys the source volume and starts the recovered writer. It also
checks missing-IPC startup refusal and fresh Google-only database initialization.

### Spaces release rehearsal

Use the [candidate publication procedure](docs/release-candidate.md) for a tested
image that does not promote production `latest`. The [rehearsal status](docs/rehearsal-status.md)
tracks clone preparation and the limits of reusing the shared demo host. Keep
candidate publication, copied-data preparation and live deployment as distinct
verified steps.
